# ARC-QR-Generator
Python Tkinter QR Code Generator

This app is a QR Code Generator that is written in python.

It creates different types of qr codes for different use cases

I have named it ARC QR Generator because my name is Axel Rothing Cano and i just took the first letters = ARC

Go to this [link](https://axeldronephoto.wixsite.com/arc-qr-generator) to open the website if you want to install the latest finished version without needing python or anything else and also you can read the release notes

to test the code, download all the files but not the README.md and store them in the same folder, then run the python script with python installed
